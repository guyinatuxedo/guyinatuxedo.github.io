# What's Next?

So it might feel like you have just watched the twelfth episode a seasonal anime. The season is over. It's finished. No new content left. The knowledge that there will probably not be a second season slowly starts to sink in. The realization that you might have to read the manga. You think for one last time about how great the characters are, how interesting the plot was...

Ok all memes aside, there is a lot more left to do. For starters you can check out `ctftime.org` to see when the next ctf is. Also you can check out some of these other resources:

```

https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap
https://github.com/ctfs/
https://pwnable.xyz/
https://pwnable.kr/
https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/ctf
https://ctf.hackucf.org/
https://365.csaw.io/
https://pwnable.tw/
https://www.pwnadventure.com/
https://ctf.katsudon.org/ctf4u/
https://google.com
```

Or you could just go out to do vr (vuln research) on real life targets.

In terms for this project, there are areas that I would like to expand upon. However between school / work / other projects, I'm not sure when I will be able to get around to it:

```
Hard Heap Exploitation
Kernel Exploitation
Embedded Exploitation
Windows Exploitation
Game Hacking (pwn adventures)
vtables
```
